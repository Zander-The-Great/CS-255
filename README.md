Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The Driver pass project was a project in which we were to work with a client to build a system for students to use via web that will allow them to practice online exams/tests and schedule driving practice with an instructor. The Client/Owner was Todd and he wanted to build a web based portal with the tools to train students to drive.


What did you do particularly well?
I feel I depicted the overall projects bigger picture to allow for us to build the system with the attention to detail that is needed to sustain and maintain the portal.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing Id like to revisit is some of the diagrams we used to interpret the build. I would improve it with peer editing. We want to make sure it is as user friendly as possible so people can navigate and use the portal intuitively. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs on a case by case basis. We need to list out all of the things the user will need to access as tools for them to use. Its important to consider the users needs as they will be the ones utilizing the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In our practice there are two main methods of which we can tackle design. Object oriented or function oriented. Depending on the complexity of the nature of the project we can go either way in the process.
